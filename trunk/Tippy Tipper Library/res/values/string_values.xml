		<h4>About Tippy Tipper</h4>
		Tippy Tipper is a simple Tipping Calculator application open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. I wrote this application to learn Android and provide an example application for others to learn from.

		If you experience any bugs or have feature requests, you can contact the developer Bryan Denny.

		<h4>Application Notes</h4>
		<b>Exclude tax:</b> <br/> 
		To disable excluding a tax rate, set the tax rate to 0%.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<b>Adjustments:</b><br/> 
		When splitting a bill, the application will divide the subtotal, tax, and tip by the number of people and then will take the floor of that value. In order to prevent underpaying a bill, an adjustment is added to the split total such that the summed split total amounts are at least equal to the value of the total bill. For example, a $10 bill split three ways would result in a $3.33 split bill amount for each person. The adjustment amount will be $0.01 so that the total summed split bill will be $10.02 instead of $9.99.
